## Folder Structure inside Global and Pages:

### Rules

- Folders must have category names or descriptive names
- Use index files for entry points of folders
- When next to index file, other files must have category names, otherwise they can be descriptive names
- Aggregator files gather contents to export as one

### Categories:

- components: holds React components
- constants: holds data that does not change
- contexts: holds React contexts
- hooks: holds React hooks
- resources: holds media files (images, vectors, videos, subtitles, music, sfx, 3d, rigs)
- styles: holds stylization files
- tests: holds test files
- types: holds type files
- utilities: holds pure functions
- animations: holds animation-related files
- services: holds request-related files
- translations: holds translation-related files

Ps: Group in folders based on functionality first, and then on categories inside these functionalities
